Group 4 developed a system in which Â writing and testing code was carried out , managing project tasks, and collaborating with other group members. Using the Git platform for version control, collaboration, and deployment of code Here are the steps taken for developing, collaborating on, and deploying the MSU CRM system using the Github platform:


1. Collaborators created a Git repository for the project. This was done using a Git hosting service called GitHub.

2. They then proceeded to develop the code, which involved writing code and committing changes to the Git repository as development progressed. This enabled the developers to keep track of changes and collaborate with other group members.

3. Through pull requests, the group members were able to review code changes, discuss issues, and merge the changes into the main codebase.

4. Once the code was ready for deployment, Git was used to deploy it to the production environment. This was done using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

5. After deployment, the team continued to use Git to manage the system. This includes making updates and improvements, fixing bugs, and collaborating with other developers.
